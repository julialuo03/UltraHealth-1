# UltraHealth Medical Database
by Ben Lischin, Julia Luo, John McCarthy, Aiden Shymanski

UltraHealth is an MVP for a streamlined medical hub where users (doctors, pharmacists, and patients) can access and change prescription data. 
This repo contains the medical database bootstrap file and REST API containing routes supporting POST and GET requests needed for our app. 

## Doctor
- A doctor must select their identity to view their list of patients
- At the bottom of the page, the doctor can click into the *Manage Patients* page, where they can either add a new patient or add a prescription to a specific patient of theirs

## Patient
- A patient must select their identity to view their list of prescriptions (current and past)
- They can also view a list of all the available pharmacies and doctors

## Pharmacist
- A pharmacist can view all the prescriptions or update a patients existing prescription
- At the bottom of the page, the pharmacist can click into the *Manage Orders* page, where they can view all recent prescription orders or fill an order for a patient
